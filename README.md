In this project, I have created a program to classify images of cars and tell if an image is of a car or not.
For the classification of the images, I have used an image classifier known as keras.
Sequential model which is a plain stack of layers where every layer has its own input and output tensor.
After this, the data is loaded using keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory.

**Importing all the necessary libraries**

This is where I started my code and imported the necessary libraries that I needed to make the image classifier work.

Here are all the libraries that Ire used in this project
